2. Start MongoDB service locally
3. Run server: `node server/app.js`
4. Access application at `http://localhost:3000`

### Production Considerations
- Set `MONGODB_URI` environment variable for production database
- Configure proper error handling and logging
- Add security middleware for production deployment
- Consider using PM2 for process management
